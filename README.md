## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository with comprehensive Prettier integration and automated code quality checks.

## Code Quality Setup

This project is configured with a complete code quality pipeline that ensures consistent formatting, linting, and validation both locally and in CI/CD.

### Tools Configured

- **Prettier**: Code formatting with NestJS-optimized rules
- **ESLint**: Code linting with TypeScript support and Prettier integration
- **Husky**: Git hooks for pre-commit validation
- **lint-staged**: Run formatters and linters on staged files only
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline for code quality checks

### Local Development

The following npm scripts are available:

```bash
# Format all TypeScript files
$ npm run format

# Check formatting without making changes
$ npm run format:check

# Run ESLint with auto-fix
$ npm run lint
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Husky is configured to run lint-staged on every commit, which will:
1. Format staged files with Prettier
2. Run ESLint with auto-fix on staged files
3. Prevent commits if there are unfixable linting errors

### CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`) runs on:
- Push to `main` and `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` and `develop` branches

The pipeline performs:
- Prettier formatting checks
- ESLint validation
- Unit tests
- Build verification

### Configuration Files

- `.prettierrc.json`: Prettier formatting rules (2025 best practices)
- `.prettierignore`: Files to exclude from formatting
- `eslint.config.mjs`: ESLint configuration with Prettier integration
- `.husky/pre-commit`: Pre-commit hook configuration
- `package.json`: lint-staged configuration
- `.vscode/`: VS Code workspace settings for optimal development
